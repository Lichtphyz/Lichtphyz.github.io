I just hit go on downloading 5000 webpages off a PC gaming website, that I will scrape tomorrow to get the data for my Metis "Luther" project.  I even set a delay of 5 seconds between pulling each page to avoid getting booted off the site.  We will see in the morning how it worked out.

If all goes well I will have quite a bit of data to use as possible 'features' (variables) in my prediction model.  I'm pretty excited about getting to apply some of this 

This morning Skip and I inadvertently solved our pair programing problem by 'inventing' a gradient descent algorithm, which unbeknowist to us was the basis of our morning lectures.

Tomorrow I give a short presentation on Self-Driving Cars, much too broad a topic for a 10-15 minute talk as it turns out, so I had to focus on a few areas.  It was suprisingly hard to get specifics on the algorithms used, partly because it isn't really a solved problem and new things are always being tried; and partly because many of the groups having the most success aren't about to give all their secrets away just yet.  It would be a dream job getting to apply some of this data science to a system like that for a living, even more so for something with more freedom than a self-driving car like a drone or ROV.  Probably need to have a PhD. in machine vision for that kind of stuff, but who knows...

Anyway, good night.  I am going to get some sleep while my computer is working the night away...
