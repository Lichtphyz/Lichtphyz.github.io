I was glancing through some basic activation functions, etc., and I realized I was taking for granted exactly what the [SoftMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) function was doing mathematically, so I took a little closer look at the equations.

I like to see visuals and interact with these things when possible, (and for fun) I used [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com) to build an [interactive applet](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pxo8h5uvx8) simulating the output of a **3-class SoftMax function**.  Desmos was a common tool I used for visuallzing functions for my physics students.  Simple as my little interactive it is, it's clearer than most of what I encountered on-line; so I thought I would share it here.

### Some notes on the interactive, Desmos doesn't support comments very well:
- The horizontal axis (z1) is the net input for 1 class
- the z2 and z3 sliders are the net input for the other two classes
- Note how the sum of the outputs for all 3 SoftMax outputs is always 1.
