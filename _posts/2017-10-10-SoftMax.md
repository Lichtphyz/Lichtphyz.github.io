I was glancing through some basic activation functions, etc., and I realized I was taking for granted exactly what the [SoftMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) function was doing mathematically, so I took a little closer look at the equations.

I like to see visuals and interact with these things when possible, (and because it's fun) I used [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com) to build an [interactive applet](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tsxekspaud) simulating the output of a **3-class SoftMax function**.  Desmos was a common tool I used for visuallzing functions for my physics students.  Simple as my little interactive it is, it's clearer than most of what I encountered on-line; so I thought I would share it here.

#### Some notes on the interactive, as Desmos doesn't support comments very well:
- The horizontal axis (z<sub>1</sub>) is the net input for 1 class

- the z<sub>2</sub> and z<sub>3</sub> sliders are the net input for the other two classes
- Note how the sum of the outputs for all 3 SoftMax outputs is always 1.
